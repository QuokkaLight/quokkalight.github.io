We finished 78th with 1650 points (out of 647 active teams).

We didn't manage to flag all the tasks like a lot of teams did (the downside of being only two :P), but we still did ok. 
There were a lot of different challenges and the CTF was pretty cool overall.

You can find the write-ups for the challenges we completed below.
